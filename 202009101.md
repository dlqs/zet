Find a subset of an array of integers A that add up to to the total sum/2.  
If I find just one subset S that sums to sum/2, I can naturally find another subset A - S that also sums to sum/2.

e.g. [1,2,3] sum = 3 -> true since partition into 1,2 and 3

e.g. [1,2,3] sum= 4 -> false

set sum to sum/2

create dp[nums.length + 1][sum + 1], where dp[i][j] is true if I can sum to j using the first i items

dp[i][j] is true if
 - I pick the ith item AND the current sum minus value of ith item is true too i.e. dp[i - 1][j - nums[i]]
 - I don't pick the ith item AND I can already sum to j with the previous i-1 items i.e. dp[i-1][j]

base cases
 - I cannot sum to any non-zero sum with no items i.e. dp[0][1...j] = false
 - I can always sum to 0 by picking 0 items i.e. dp[0][0...i] = true
