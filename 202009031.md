Query processing

Query plan: query in tree form
 - logical:  relational algebra tree, e.g. selection projection join nodes...
 - physical: logical + access and implementation details
   - access: file or index (is the attribute I want already in an index?)
   - implementation (for operator): e.g. for join, do I want a hash join or block nested loop join...

Query execution
 - pipelined
   - applies parent operator to tuples directly as they are generated by child operators
   - no sync issues
   - saves cost of writing out intermediate results
   - always do this when possible!
 - materialized
   - write out entire intermediate table
   - sometimes necessary when the intermediate table needs to be examined multiple times
   - easy as heck to implement
   - but usually no good compared to pipelined
   
Most optimizers work on a single SPJ (select-project-join) block

Operator algos (halfway to query optimization)
 - cost estimate: number of disk I/Os to read/compute result
 - do not count I/Os to write because we won't always write the result out
 - refer to notes for costs for joins, selects, respective operators etc.
 
Query optimization: there are many equivalent logical and physical plans, just need to pick a good one

In general
 - enumerate a couple of plans
 - estimate the cost (based on above)
 - choose the lowest
 - voila: cost based optimization
 
Enumerate?
 - select: commutative, cascading (push-down)
 - projection: cascade
 - joins: commutative, associative, reorder, cascading
 
Many, many plans
 - left deep trees, bushy, (and right deep, but often not discussed)
 - convention: left operand is outer relation, right operand is inner relation
 - left deep tree: inner relations (right operand) are all base tables
 - can be mostly pipelined (visualize a LDT with two nested loop nodes...)
 - e.g. for nested loop join
 ```
 for tuple <- outer relation
     for tuple <- inner relation
     ...
 ```
 - exponentially many plans
 
Query optimization
  - heuristics
    - works on logical plan
    - based on rules such as push down selection, projection
  - cost based
    - sum up cost of tree i.e. all its operators, see below
    - works on both logical and physical plans
    - can generate new plans based on dp, simulated annealing, top-down/bottom-up algos
    - by generate I really mean transform an existing plan into another
  
 How to sum up cost
  - start bottom up!
  - for each operator, generate output cost and stastical summary of output (which will be used to calculate cost of the parent operator)
  - most important stastical summary: number of tuples
  - cost is aforementioned operator algo cost, but now its time to pick the algo (say, for join)
  - selection: number of tuples / unique values
  - projection: same
  - join: multiply and divide by larger number of unique values
  
 Query optimization
  - can stop early if we meet some cost threshold (cost of optimization is more than cost of plan)
  - can be cached
  - can be greatly affected by cardinality estimations (which form the base for statistical summary of outputs)
  - see "How Good Are Query Optimizers, Really?" by Leis et al
  
 DP query optimization
  - Say S is set of relations being joined
  - Enumerate all subsets of S, say T and calculate cost of T join (S - T).
  - Base case: |S| = 1, i.e. one relation only
  - store cost and reuse
  - O(3^n)
  - restrict with LDT
    - fix the right hand side to always be a base relation
    - O(n2^n), profit
    - (sometimes the best plan is not LDT i.e. bushy tree but is the cost really worth it???)
