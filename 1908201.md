Background
 - In 1963. Cleveland detective, McFadden, gets suspicious when Terry (and others) behave suspiciously in front of 
a store, thinking that they were "casing" the store. 
 - McFadden then stops and frisks them
 - Weapons are found on them, and Terry and others were charged with illegally carrying
concealed weapons.

Terry appealed, eventually to the Supreme Court.
 - Terry argued that the stop and frisk was a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. So 
 they should exclude as evidence, the weapons, under the exclusionary rule.

Court said
 - No (8-1). Okay as long as there is "resonable suspicion".
 - Lower level of "probable cause". Hunch < reasonable suspicion < probable cause
 - Frisk limited to weapons only.
 
Impact
 - expanded police authority under police crime investigations, particularly when looking for weapons
 - enable detention based on reasonable suspicion
 - extended by Hiibel v. Nevada (about asking for ID during Terry stops)

Frisk: to pat down to search for weapons, or illegal stuff
