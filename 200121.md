Start by "inventing" a combinator for the task  
`def char(c: Char): Parser[Char]` <- an invented type Parser, parameterized on the result type
 - we want more than just true/false
 - if it succeeds, we want the result
 - if it fails, we want the error
 
We need a way to "run" our parser:  
`def run[A](p: Parser[A])(input: String): Either[ParseError, A]` <- an invented type for errors

Put these in an interface:  
`trait Parsers[ParseError, Parser[+_]]` <- interface fits any type of parser

Parsing repititions:  
`def listOfN[A](n: Int, p: Parser[A]): Parser[List[A]]`

Own API design

To count 0 or more occurances of something  
`def count[A](p: Parser[A]): Int`  
`run(count("a"))("aaa") == Right(3)`  
`run(count("a" | "b"))("cab") == Right(0)`  
`run(count("a" | "b"))("abc") == Right(2)` <- but there is no error to report?

To count only if at least X occurances of something, can extend count:
`def countAtLeast[A](p: Parser[A], atLeast = 0 :Int): Either[ParseError, A]`  

A parser that recognizes zero or more 'a', followed by one or more 'b', and which results in the pair of counts of characters seen...
Perhaps a way to concatenate parsers (ADD analgous to OR)  
`def add[A](p: Parser[A], p2: Parser[A]): Parser[A]`  
`run(add("hello" | "hi", "world"))("hiworld") == Right("hiworld")`  
`run(count(add("hello" | "hi", "world")))("hiworldhelloworld") == Right(2)`  
Call this +

Commutativity of +: Nope. Doesn't make sense for "a" + "b" to be parsed the same as "b" + "a"  
Commutativity of |: e.g. "a" | "aa" and we encounter "aa". Is this 2x count of the parser "a" or 1x count of the latter parser "aa"?  

Associativity of +: Yes. ("a" + "b") + "c" as good as "a" + ("b" + "c")  
Associativity of |: e.g. ("a" | "b") | "c" v. "a" | ("b" | "c")
