Ancient Greeks were first to ask about world rationally, not by tradition

Variety of philosophers in Ancient Greece.
 - pre-Socratic philosphers
 - Socrates, teacher of Plato
 - Plato, who founded Academy, Platonism, and was the teacher of Aristotle
 - Aristotle founded Lyceum, the Peripatetic school of philosophy
 - the first skeptic, Pyrrho, who didn't believe that falling off cliffs was dangerous. 
 But he lived to over 90!
 - Other schools: Epicureanism, Stoicism

Unfortunately, the Roman empire became Christianized!
 - closed down ancient schools of philospohy
 - 391AD: Library of Alexandria declined and purged
 - 591AD: all non-Christian schools closed, including Plato's Academy, which had been going for hundreds of years.
Very few texts from these ancient philosophers
on Skeptics: 3 texts only

Plato also had influence on early Christian doctrine
 - Incarnation (?)
 - Trinity: Idea of Good, Nous (Son), Pneuma (World Soul, aka Holy Spirit) 
 - above ideas recognized as analogous with notion of Christian God.

Aristotle influenced medival Christian thinkger Aquinas
 - knowledge is not innate but is gained from the reports of the senses and from logical inference from 
 self-evident truths.

Synthesis of Christianism and Arisotlism: Scholasticism
 - dominated in 1100-1700
 - one school of Catholic philosophy

Aristotle's world view?
 - Above Moon: good, heavenly
 - Under Moon: Earth, not heavenly
