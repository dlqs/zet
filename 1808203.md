Kierkegaard
 - first Existentialist: the exploration of the nature of existence of the feeling, living
 human being, not just the "thinker". Usually stems from *dread*.
 - Christian, individualistic, has an indirect style of writing.

On objective truth vs subjective truth: 
 - Objective:
   - empirically verifiable e.g. science, or
   - abstract logic e.g. maths
   - mostly governed by *consensus*: "because others say so"
 - Subjective:
   - personal, individual truths
   - that which must be experienced personally
   - use personal experience as the reference point
   - turns out, most of life's truths fall in this category

For example, mortality:
 - Objective:
   - All human beings eventually die -> we are human beings -> we will eventually die
   - observation + inference!
 - Subjective:
   - Must experience (this is much harder)
   - But the cold, intimate impress of death is really convincing
   
On religious life:
 - Faith in God is not just accumulating empirical observations and/or logical arguments
 - religious faith is a *subjective* affair which must be experienced firsthand
 - This explains some differences:
   - between the scientific and religious worldview
   - the difference stems from different reference points, experiences, source of truth
 - Faith isn't about knowing things
   - Faith takes over when objective certainty ends
   - There's a lot of objective uncertainty
   - In other words, doubt
   
On doubt:
   - Zealot: claims that the existence of God is an objective truth
   - Knight: believes it himself as a subjective, in the face of all doubt
   - Doubt enhances faith, a kind of inward passion
   - Common quips like "its how I grew up" or "never tried anything else" are not enough

So what are our lives about?
 - most people are living in the *aesthetic mode*: maximize pleasure, minimize pain
 - but it's not final mode! because...
 - pleasure diminishes over time, allures exhaust
 - We realize we're in a hamster wheel: chasing pleasure, depleting it, chasing another pleasure
 - Move on to the ethical mode: doing what's right for its own sake
 - e.g. parenthood. Having and taking care of your own child.
 - Still not the final mode? Kierkegaard says...
 - the religious mode of existence: obdience to God.
 - e.g. God commands Abraham to make a human sacrafice of his son, Issac, which he does. A+!
 - Sometimes secular ethics meets religious ethics, and this is where Abraham sets the bar for "excellence".
 - or, the Leap of Faith.
 
On dread, the source of existentialism:
 - is an ontological category: inescapable constituent of existence
 - i.e. dread is *part of* existence
 - is a desire for what we fear, and a fear of what we desire
 - dread: an acknowledgement of human freedom?
 - thanatos drive(?)
