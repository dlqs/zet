Data tends to outlives processes. Data needs to be written to disk, piped to another process, sent through networks. To do this, data can be serialized.
Serialization/Marshalling and deserialization/unmarshalling refer to the same thing.

Serialization means to translate data structures or objects to a byte stream.

Common textual formats: JSON, XML, YAML
Common binary formats: MessagePack, Protobuf, Java Object Serialization (doesn't really have a name)

Considerations:
 - human friendliness: directly readable?
 - size: e.g. large numbers can be represented much smaller in binary
 - speed
 - interop with programming language, e.g. Javascript vis a vis JSON
 
 Do not confuse with:
  - compression
  - encoding (a more general term)
