covariance: if T is subtype of S, Container[T] is subtype of Container[S]
 - Java: List<? extends S> can accept any T that extends (subtype of) S
 - Scala: List[+A] can accept any B that extends (subtype of) A
 - "anything A and below"

contravariance: if T is subtype of S, Container[S] is subtype of Container[T] (opposite of covariance)
 - Java: List<? super S> can accept any T that is a superclass of S
 - Scala: List[-A] can accept any B that is a superclass of A
 - "anything A and above, all the way up to Object"
 
 data sharing: since data structures are immutable, we can always share.  
 removing head of a list is really just returning its tail.  
 functional data structures are persistent.
 e.g. append involves only moving pointers.
 
 Improving type inference for higher order functions
  - curry them!
  - use multiple argument groups, and the type information will flow from left to right
  - I guess this is similar to type pinning in Ocaml
  
fodldRight is not tail recursive, foldleft usually is

exercises here that involve constructing a new list with Cons can usually be done efficiently via foldRight, 
because we're constructing a singly linked list. Think continously adding to the head and returning the last head at the end.

algebriac data types yada yada   
each data type is sum or union of its constructors  
each constructor is product of its arguments  
see sealed trait

fold for trees
