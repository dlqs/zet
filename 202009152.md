For O(n) space and time. Simply consider that the answer must necessarily be between 1 and nums.length.
So just ignore all items in nums which are out of range and count the frequency of items in range.
Then traverse through the frequency array to find first one which has no occurances.

For constant space store that info back into the nums array. See LC discussion

https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/

Insert/remove if not exist and get random.

Set: can insert/remove in O(1) but cannot get random O(1): need access to the backing array

ArrayList: cannot do insert/remove if not exists O(1) but can get random O(1).

Combine hashmap and arraylist: use hashmap to track locations elements inside of the arraylist.

On insert: add the number to nums list and put location in locations hashmap

On remove: in nums, move the element to be removed to the back and shrink the nums list by 1 (this will be O(1) remove)

On getRandom: index into a random position inside nums
