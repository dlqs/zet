For O(n) space and time. Simply consider that the answer must necessarily be between 1 and nums.length.
So just ignore all items in nums which are out of range and count the frequency of items in range.
Then traverse through the frequency array to find first one which has no occurances.

For constant space store that info back into the nums array. See LC discussion

https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/

Insert/remove if not exist and get random.

Set: can insert/remove in O(1) but cannot get random O(1): need access to the backing array

ArrayList: cannot do insert/remove if not exists O(1) but can get random O(1).

Combine hashmap and arraylist: use hashmap to track locations elements inside of the arraylist.

On insert: add the number to nums list and put location in locations hashmap

On remove: in nums, move the element to be removed to the back and shrink the nums list by 1 (this will be O(1) remove)

On getRandom: index into a random position inside nums

Annoying ass question

https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-mutable

Create a segment tree of sum type with an update method.

https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/

Formulate the problem as keeping track of the current highest point given a list of heights,
start times and end times. Skyline can only change at either L or R of building. Add to a PQ when building height starts, and remove when ends. Keep polling for highest point. Use a TreeMap since PQ's remove is O(N). Sorting the starts and ends correctly will handle the edge cases gracefully.
Also keep track of previous height and only add to results when previous height changes.
 - 2 buildings start at same x: favor higher
 - 2 buildings ending at same x: favor lower
 - building ends at same x as another one starts: favor  start
