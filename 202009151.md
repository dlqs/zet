Binary tree: given a node, hard to find next node. Given just a leaf node, impossible to find
next node. (Can't go left/right child, and can't go upwards to parent)

Threaded binary tree: Make right child pointer that would normally be null point to successor node.
Make left child pointer that would normally be null point to predecessor node.

Successor/predecessor is normally same as in-order traversal of tree, but could be different too.

Single threaded: each node threaded to left OR right
Double threaded: each node threaded to left AND right

Morris traversal: in-order tree traversal constant space. Based on threaded binary tree.
 - set curr to root
 - while curr is not null,
   - if curr has left child, move curr to the right child of the rightmost node of curr's left child.
  then go to left child.
   - if curr does not have left child, print curr and go to right child 
 
Basically keep moving the current node "below and to the right" of any left child. This modifies the tree.

The implementation without having to preserve the binary tree is easier. If we have to preserve,
