Futures
 - operation that completes asynchronously
 - like a lightweight thread, but much less overhead
 - can run hundred of thousands/millions
 - returns immediately, use *blocking* `Await.result` to fetch results

Promises
 - Promises are "write" side of Futures, Futures are the "read" side
 - adds `success`, `failure`, `onComplete`
 
Both are equivalent to callbacks and can always be rewritten to look like one

Asynchronous ops
 - use `map` to work on result of a Future: kinda like `Promise.then`
 - use `zip`/`Future.sequence` as barrier for multiple Futures: kinda like `Promise.all`
 
Parallel vs Async web crawling
 - parallel
   - one thread per HTTP request
   - barrier at each depth
 - async
   - recursive
   - use `AsyncHttpClient`, as the `requests` package contains synchronous methods
   - remember to flatten results from recursion

Use of thread pool for applications
 - generally, keep 1 and share its context around, since thread pools are expensive to start
 - can change size of thread pool easily based on hardware
 - can switch to SingleThreadPool to debug things involving concurrency etc.

Async concurrency allows for more concurrency than blocking parallelism, will improve time for **non-CPU bound workloads**.
