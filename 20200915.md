LinkedHashMap: HashMap with ordered keys.
There's a doubly linked list running through the entries.

Order can be insertion-order (the default) or access-order (this is usually what we want). 
Toggle with `boolean accessOrder` in constructor.

Easy to build Least Recently Used (LRU) cache by overriding `removeEldestEntry()`.
`insertion-order`/`access-order` determines when this method will be invoked, i.e. on other
methods that "insert" the map or merely "access" the map. Check API. In addition, this method
should return whether the eldest entry should be removed or not. For a LRU cache with a max
capacity, this is usually what we want:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  int MAX_ENTRIES = 10;
  LinkedHashMap<Integer, Integer> hm =
    new LinkedHashMap<>(capacity, 0.75f, true) {
      @Override
      protected boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry) {
        return size() > MAX_ENTRIES;
      }
    }
}

```

Take a copy of any kind of map while preserving the order
```
Map copy = new LinkedHashMap(original);
```
