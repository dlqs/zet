title: Reading Hands On Scala

Notes:
 - JVM, automatic memory management etc. Though there are some attempts at native
 - Ammonite is a nice REPL, much like utop
 - automatic end of block return
 - type inference
 - an argument in the class constructor automatically creates attribute. A lot less verbose.
 ```
 # Java
 class Car {
     double velocity;
     Car(double velocity, <etc>) {
         this.velocity = velocity;
         <ad infinitum>
     }
 }
 # Scala
 class Car(velocity: Double, <etc>) {
 }
 ```
 - ability to directly iterate over elements. Flatten multiple for loops. Use guards.
 ```
 for (row <- matrix; col <- row) {
 }
 for (i <- row if i % 2 == 0)
 ```
 - Expressions, though not till the level of OCaml where everything is an expression.
 - Pattern matching, though I'm not sure why its *not* the idomatic way to handle options. 
 - Operator overloading, which is not available in Java. While its nice, I believe its sometimes over used (?)
 ```
 # which is clearer?
 list += item
 list.add(item)
 ```
