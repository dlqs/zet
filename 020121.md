monomorphic functions: functions that operate on only one type of data  
polymorphic functions: operate on any type  
not OOP polymorphic but parametric polymorphism  

Sometimes polymorphic functions have only one implementation

Scala has interfaces for functions with only 1 arg (Function1), 2 (Function2) etc.

Stdlib provives compose for Function1, andThen.  
f andThen g is same as g compose f is same as g(f(x))
