 - parentheses are not always needed, even for methods

Anonymous functions
 - `_` automatically denotes first argument: `ints.map(_*2)`
 - or the old fashioned way: `ints.map(i => i*2)`
 - or, for longer code blocks: `ints.map(i => {i * 2})`
 
The `new` keyword
 - In Java, used to create things on the heap (unless they're [optimized away](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16505966/does-javas-new-keyword-necessarily-denote-heap-allocation)) 
 - In Scala, its only needed to call default constructor.
