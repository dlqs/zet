Pure functions are functions without side effects, e.g. + on integers.

An expression is referentially transparent if all of its occurances can be replaced by its evaluation.
 - everything a function does is represented by its return value
 - lets us do substitution model, i.e. just keep substituting expressions with their results, like an algebriac equation
 - equational reasoning (?)
 
e.g. .length on a String is RT since Strings in Java are immutable
```
String s = new String("abc");
s.length(); // -> 3
```
Wherever s.length() appears, it can be replaced with 3

e.g. .append on StringBuilder is not RT. When append is called, previous state of StringBuilder is destroyed.
```
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("abc");
sb.append("d").toString(); // -> abcd
sb.append("d").toString(); // -> abcdd
```
We cannot replace every occurance of sb.append("d") with "abcd".

Benefits of RT
 - more modular
 - local reasoning
 
Note that exception throwing also counts as breaking RT
