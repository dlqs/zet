Implicit parameters are params which can be automatically inferred based on its type and value *in scope*.
No need to pass in the parameter manually!

Implicit conversion function converts one type to another automatically, without needing to be called.

## Implicit context
Defining an implicit context: use `implicit` keyword, in argument:
`def getEmployee(id)(implicit e: ExecutionContext) = ...`

Just a shortcut to pass around extra arguments.
