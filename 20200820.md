Background
 - Early 1991: Somalia civil war breaks out. SNA disbands into clan militias. 
 - Severe fighting breaks out throughout Mogadishu, the capital, among various clan militias.
 - Late 1992: Despite UN and US relief efforts, half a million Somalis dead and 
 1.5 million are displaced. US sends in ground forces in Dec.
 - Early 1993: UN brokers peace agreement among 15 or so clans, but one of the larger clan leaders,
 Aidid, doesn't cooperate.
 - Almost 60 Pakistani peacekeepers are killed in an attack ordered by Aidid. Aidid becomes 
 wanted.
 - Jul 1993: Bloody Monday: US forces blow up a house which they suspect contains Aidid. He is not
 there. 50 Somalis are killed. Somalis rapidly lose trust in US forces.
 - 3 Oct 1993: US launches mission to capture two of Aidid's top lieutenants. Battle begins.
 
 Battle
  - Plan is to enter by air, capture, leave by ground. No more than 30 minutes.
  - Two Black Hawks are shot down which drags out the process.
  - Instead of 30 minutes, battle lasts 15 hours. Severe fighting ensues and 18 Americans are
  killed.
  
 Impact
  - US withdraws forces from Somalia a year later.
  - Somali civil war continues.
  - Clinton takes blame, for the battle and subsequent early withdrawal.
  - Key reason why US did not intervene in later conflicts such as Rwandan genocide of 1994.
