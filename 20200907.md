Actors
 - aka message-based parallelism
 - every actor runs concurrently
 - has local state, makes local decisions
 - communicate only via asynchronous messages
 - Erlang, Akka
 - e.g. email is an actor system: humans are the actors and email addresses are actor addresses
 - actors can send messages to themselves (via sendAsync, so that they don't block themselves)
 
Castor is an simple actor framework for Scala. Akka is another, but its more complicated 
and suited for production use.

Castor Actors
 - SimpleActor
   - defines a run that runs on each message
 - BatchActor
   - defines runBatch that runs on groups of messages at a time
 - on exception: retry
 - StateMachineActor
   - actor is a set of distinct states, each of which has a separate run *and* returns the next
 state to transition to
   - on exception: will not transit state
 - actors are meant to manage mutable internal state, and it is up to us to not touch an
 actor's state from elsewhere
 - requires Context, similar to how Futures require an ExecutionContext

Actors vs Futures
 - actors are good for streaming, i.e. one way dataflow
   - e.g. logging, metrics, monitoring
   - futures are better for request-response
   - e.g. HTTP, database queries
 - messages have order preserved
   - futures may be scheduled arbitrarily
 - private mutable state, without needing locks. Actors are single-threaded
   - Futures may run in parallel
   
Request throttling with actors
 - starts at idle
 - receive message while idle -> transit to buffering
 - receive message while buffering -> add to buffer
 - after N seconds, check buffer for messages. If have, send and transit to buffering
 for another N seconds. If none, transit to idle.
 
 
Logging as an example
 - concurrent async logging, log rotation, log uploading
 - actors can take other actors(' addresses) as arguments
 - multi stage: e.g. app -> base64 -> disk -> log.txt
 - non linear: app -> sanitize -> base64 -> upload -> blah.com
                                        |-> disk -> log.txt
 - use SplitActor to send messages to two downstream actors
 - can easily rearrange pipeline
 - debug with context logging
