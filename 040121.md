exceptions break RT and introduce context depedence
 - exceptions should only be used for error handling, not control flow
 - exceptions are not type safe

check exceptions force a decision to handle, but don't work for HOF.

partial function: not defined for some inputs

B >: A: supertype of A

We can define a general Try function that wraps exception based code into Option based code.

sequence: map over a list using a function that may fail, returning None if any element returns None
traverse: same as sequence but one pass

Option tells us something went wrong but not *what* went wrong.

To track what went wrong, we can use Either.
