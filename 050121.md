List(1, 2, 3).map().filter().map() will produce 3 intermediate lists, each one as the input to the next transformation.
This is inefficient!

Automatic loop fusion through laziness.

Functions can be non-strict: may choose to not evaluate its arguments. Strict functions always evaluate all args.

For example, && or || don't evaluate all args under certain conditions. if-then-else as well. 
The other expression that isn't branched to will not be evaluated.

We can pass thunks, or unevaluated expressions around: `def if(... onTrue: () => A, onFalse: () => A):A ...`

For no arg thunks such as above, there is a shortcut: `def if(... onTrue: => A)` (omit empty parens)

Scala wraps no arg thunks automatically. Thunks will be evaluated once for each appearance inside the 
body of a function.
`def maybeTwice(b: Boolean, i : => Int) = if (b) i+i else 0`  
Can directly pass expression as arg to i (Scala wraps it), and can directly reference value of i without parentheses.

Non strict functions take arguments by name, not value.

Variable args: use * operator
e.g. `def apply[A](as: A*)`  
Convert List or Seq to varargs: use _* operator
e.g. `apply(myList: _*)`

Transformations for stream are interleaved. Sometimes called first class loops. 
Lower working set size as well.

lazy keyword defers execution till the name is referenced.
```
val x = { println("evaluated right now") }
lazy val y = { println("evaluated when y is referenced" }
```
Recursive function consumes data, corecursive functions produce data.

Unfold is the dual of fold; it is also an example of a corecursive function.
 - Fold: fold many things into one value
 - Unfold: generate many values from one thing
 - Use an Option to indicate when to stop recursive generation
 - (if its an infinite stream, obviously don't ever return None)
 
Pattern matching tuples in anonymous functions: use `{ case (a, b) => ... }` syntax
