Problem: Find sum of integers in an array [a, b, c ...] given a range. 

Solution? Create a cumulative sum array [a, a+b, a+b+c ...]. 
To get sum given range [i, j], simply take cumsum[i] - cumsum[j] e.g. range[1,2] will result in a+b+c - a = b+c

O(1) time to query sum, but update takes O(n) since we need to update entire cumsum.

Segment Trees (aka statistics tree) can do both in O(lgn).

ST is a
 - binary tree
 - nodes represent information of intervals, e.g. some info for [0, 2]...
 - space is O(nlgn) since there are nlgn nodes required
 - leaf nodes are point intervals e.g. [1, 1]. Basically elements of the input array
 - root node is for the entire input [0 ... n] and root.left is [0 ... mid] and root.right is [mid+1 ... n]

To build tree
 - recursive from root
 - base case: point interval [i, i]: sum == element
 - inductive: given two nodes [i, j] and [j+1, k], we can construct [i, k] by adding their sums together.
 
To query for sum
 - recursive again
 - base case: if the query interval matches exactly, we are at the correct node, so just return the sum there.
 - else check if the query interval lies entirely in either the left or right child nodes, if it does, recurse that way
 - else, the query interval is spread across child nodes. e.g. [1, 3] but my child nodes are [0, 2] and [3, 4]
 - then simply recurse with [1, 2] and [3, 3].
 
 To update
  - find the point interval and update, and also remember to update sums along the way down

API
 - buildTree
 - sumTree
 - updateTree (only required if elements are expected to change)

Commonly used for **range sum queries**
 - `node.sum = node.left.sum + node.right.sum;`
 - but can also be used for
 - range min: change to `node.min = Math.min(node.left.min, node.right.mid);`
 - range xor, range product, range max
 - just change the thing above to whatever
