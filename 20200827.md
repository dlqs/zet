Reflection is the ability of a program to examine or "introspect" itself, and to manipulate
its own properties at runtime.

e.g. invoke a method by string matching its name, or listing all method names of a given class

Languages like C, C++ have no such ability but others like Java, offer an API to do so.

Reflection is useful for
 - making generic libraries, such as for serializing different kinds of data
 - runtime creation of mock objects for testing
 - bypass member accessibility rules (dangerous?)
 - metaprogramming in general
