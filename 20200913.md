https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/

We want to keep track of which events are attendable and attend the one that ends the earliest.
Use a priority queue (min heap) that contains the end day of *attendable* events. Or segment tree (more troublesome).

Simple 1d dp

https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/

Small adjustment to previous question; just do once for 0 to n - 2 and 1 to n - 1.

https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/

Interesting tree based dp. Quite a different solution from ii, but short. Work from leaf nodes upwards.
