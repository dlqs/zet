In Scala
 - All values have a type
 - Types superclass of Any
 - Nothing is subtype of everything
 - Functions can be passed subclass instances
 - Functions can return subclass instances

Recall: Liskov Substitution Principle
 - If S is a subtype of T, then objects of T may be replaced with those of S without altering any
desirable properties of the program.

Higher kinded types/generics/types with parameters: types implemented in terms of another type.   
e.g. List[T].
 - **List[T]** is the generic
 - List[**T**] is the type parameter
 - List[**Int**], List[**Any**] are known as parameterized types

Two axes of subclassing
 - container superclass/subclass orthogonal to *its contents* superclass/subclass
 - *Variance* is correlation between these two
 - aka inheritance relationship between these parameterized types
 
Three types of variance:

Covariance (the easiest, you should already know this)
 - if U is subclass of T, Container[U] is also subclass of Container[T]
 - e.g. Dog subclass of Animal, so List[Dog] also subclass List[Animal]
 - so that we can plug in U wherever T is expected
 - problematic when adding or changing values
 - use `List[+T]`
 
Contravariance
 - reverse of Covariance (stunning, I know)
 - if U is subclass of T, *Container[T]* is subclass of Container[U]
 - useful for processors or consumers of values
 - Consumer[T] can consume U instances (just the T parts)
 - problematic when returning or producing values
 - use `List[-T]`
 
Invariant
 - even if U is subclass of T, Container[T] and Container[U] have no relationship
 - default behaviour.
 
 Positions (where the respective type parameters can live)
  - Covariant positions: method returns
  - Contravariant positions: method arguments
  - Invariant positions: mutable vars
  - Covariant cannot appear in contravariant positions, vice versa
  - Both cannot appear in invariant positions (e.g. can't have -A as a var)
 
 Covariant in contravariant position: Error!
  - Here's why. Imagine we have
 ```
 class Box[+Pet] ...
     def swap(newPet: Pet)
 ```
  - next, I create Box[Cat]
  - and swap my cat with a dog (which is also a Pet, so it works). 
  - Now my Box[Cat] contains a Dog! Bad dog!
 
 Contravariant in covariant position: Error!
 ```
 class Sitter[-Pet] ...
     def walk(): Pet = ...
 ```
  - Cat sitter can be replaced by a Pet sitter (remember, contravariant)
  - create Sitter[Cat]
  - say walk() for cat, in violation of the laws of physics, 
  returns a Dog (which is still a Pet, so it works)
  - Now my sitter is sitting a Dog, which they are not equipped for
  
When to use what
 - Covariance
   - containers
   - whenever you want to get the thing out and use it
 - Contravariance
   - Consumers 
   - want to processs the item, but we only need *a part* of the thing
 - Invariance
   - Distinct types, markers, labels
  
Constraints
 - Upper bounds
   - when the other parameter is same or subtype
   - use `B <: A` 
 - Lower bounds
   - when the other parameter is same or supertype
   - use `B >: A`: B has to be same type as A or supertype
   - e.g. can be used to *widen* container. e.g. adding Double to List[Int] will turn into List[Any]
   - compiler will find lowest upper bound
 - View bounds
   - deprecated, but basically indicates implicit conversion
 - Context bounds
   - `[A : Ctx]`
   - Indicates A has some context Ctx
   - Evidence parameter
     - `def ctxBound[X:M](x:X) = ???`
     
Typeclass pattern: external impl of an interface
 - no need to extend class directly, no need source code
 - introduce via context bound
 - e.g. can define an Adder[Pair[Int]] in terms of a given Adder[Int]
 
How
 - define interface
 - implement for your class
 - introduce implicit scope
 - pass to function as parameter or type constraint
 - call methods on interface
 
```
// My interface
trait Adder[A] {
  def add(x:A, y:A):A
}

// Place in implicit scope
implicit val IntAdder = new Adder[Int] {
  override def add(x:Int, y:Int):Int = x + y
}

// In some other place...
def addThings[T: Adder](x: T, y: T): T = {
  implicitly[Adder[T]].add(x, y)
}
```
