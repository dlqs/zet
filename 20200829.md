ADTs: can be algebriac in two ways: product, and sum types

Product
 - structure of compounded types
 - e.g. records, tuples, structs
 - e.g. two member -> pair type
 - correspondence to logical AND
 - record in OCaml (named), tuple in OCaml (unnamed)

Sum/variant/discriminated union/tagged union
 - structure that can be one of several different, but fixed, types
 - "tag" indicates which field is used, e.g. the constructor used
 - e.g. variant in OCaml, sealed trait in Scala, no such thing in C (only a ugly manual hack)
 or Go
 - correspondence to logical OR
 - can be recursive, useful for trees
```
type binary_tree = 
  | Leaf of int
  | Tree of binary_tree * binary_tree
```
  - can be paratemerized, e.g. what if we want to create a *generic* binary tree?
  - useful for pattern matching
  
How are ADTs useful? Error handling, starting with Options
 - Can be Some of val or None
 - better than null, any language with null, has that as the implicit option type
 - how did Go get this wrong?
   - multiple return values (result, nil) instead of real sum types...
   - does not seem to make anyone happy
