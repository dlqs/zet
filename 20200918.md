How it works
 - NOT a binary tree, just a plain ol' tree
 - Tree conceptually but we manipulate the backing array directly (much like with a heap)
 - each node represents a sum over a certain "range" depending on the index's binary representation
 - each index is translated into a binary number whose sum is broken down
 - for example: e.g. index 10 = 1010 = 1000 + 10 (node whose range is 0-8 plus 2 elements after that
 - so we sum up constituents of the binary representation, which in tree-speak means summing up from node to root
 - `getParent`: position i: `i = i - (i & -i)`
 - to build the tree, we go the other way: from root to node
 - `getNext`: position i: `i + (i & -i)` (why? ancient chinese secrets...)
 - note: the backing array has +1 element more than the original array, to represent the root at index 0 whose sum is 0
 - note: root 0 is its own parent, so don't call getParent on zero

2's complement
 - recall that **signed integers** are usually represented in 2's complement
 - a 0 MSB indicates positive (e.g. 0111 1111 = 127), 1 indicates negative (e.g. 1000 0001 = -127) (**remember to use all 8 bits**)
 - to flip the sign: invert the bits (NOT) then add 1 (ignoring any overflow)
 
versus segment tree
 - segment trees can be used to sum range and more, just by modifying the merge condition. Fenwick trees are just for sum range.
 - segment tree nodes cover *disjoint* ranges. fenwick tree nodes cover overlapping ranges.
 - segment trees are binary trees, fenwick trees are not.
 - both are O(nlgn) for build tree
 - both are O(lgn) for sum range and O(lgn) for point update
 - fenwick trees can be easily manipulated as a array, so a little easier/faster to code than segment trees
 - that being said, segment trees can also be manipulated as array, since they're full binary trees

API
 - sumRange(i, j): really is just sumRange(j) - sumRange(i - 1). O(lgn).
 - update(i, val)
   - calculate the difference between the new val and the old val and updateTree on this element as well as its children
   - this is why we keep the original nums array around.
   - *remember to update the original nums array!* Or else two consecutive updates will not work.
   - O(lgn)
 - private: updateTree(i, val): this updates adds changes to a given node, and all of its next nodes
 - buildTree(int[] nums): update the tree array with updateTree and nums, one-by-one. O(nlgn)


Just memorize `i = i + (i & -i)` for `getNext`, `i = i - (i & -i)` for `getParent` and don't call getParent on zero
